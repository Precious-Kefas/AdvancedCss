Hello! This is your new robot friend and I have a fun little challenge for you.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,230
I've created this robot that is actually pretty cool.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,310
So as you hover, his head grows big and he can also dance:

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,720
Now here's the challenge: I've created the majority of this robot.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,360
But you first need to assemble it, so it looks like this.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:35,030
And in the next section I've left a few files for you: an index file and the CSS file.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:42,430
The only problem is that these parts are all over the page and I need you to assemble them, so that you

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,190
can have a robot friend as well.

9
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:51,100
In the following section after the exercise I'll have the solution, that you can use, but give it a try

10
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,660
and hopefully you'll have a new robot friend too.
